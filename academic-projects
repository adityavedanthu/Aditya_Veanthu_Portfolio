# Academic Projects
## 1. Leanspace - Space Hackathon
Developed a unique satellite monitoring system using the Leanspace Cloud platform to address space debris. The system features notifications indicating the intensity of critical faults or failures.

## 2. Deorbit and Solar Cycle
*Master's Thesis*  
Developed parallel gravity and atmospheric models to predict the lifetime and trajectory of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, considering solar and geomagnetic activity.  
*Project Guide:* Dr. Patrick Harkness - University of Glasgow

## 3. Path Planning for Planetary Rovers and Drones
Developed path planning algorithms in MATLAB using fuzzy logic and neural networks to enhance autonomous rover and drone navigation.

## 4. Fault Detection, Isolation & Recovery System for UAV Heading Motion
Designed a system for fault detection, isolation, and recovery in UAV lateral dynamics, applicable to both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.

## 5. Flight Control System Design for Restricted Motion Twin Rotor UAV
*Master's Team Design Project*  
Developed mathematical models representing elevation, pitch, and yaw motions of a twin UAV system. Implemented control algorithms with experimental validation.  
*Team Members:* Abhijit Tom, Mohit Garg, Kethan Kode, Kavya Venkateshwaran
