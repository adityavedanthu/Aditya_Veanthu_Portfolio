## Publications

1. **The pulse-elevator: A pump for granular materials**  
   *Acta Astronautica, 2022* – [DOI Link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actaastro.2022.07.052)  
   - Introduced a novel “pulse-elevator” mechanism for transporting granular materials, integrating vibro-conveyor and Tesla valve concepts. Validated through analytical, numerical, and experimental studies for space applications.  

2. **Replacement of aircraft’s oleo-pneumatic hydraulic shock-absorbing system with an electromagnetic system**  
   *International Astronautical Congress (IAC), 2019* – [Paper Link](https://dl.iafastro.directory/event/IAC-2019/paper/51055/)  
   - Proposed an electromagnetic landing gear shock-absorber as an alternative to conventional oleo-pneumatic systems, leveraging Halbach arrays and sensor-based control for space and terrestrial applications.  

3. **Construction of human habitats on planetary/lunar surfaces without direct human involvement**  
   *International Astronautical Congress (IAC), 2018* – [Paper Link](https://dl.iafastro.directory/event/IAC-2018/paper/48021/)  
   - Outlined a robotic swarm-based strategy to build underground lunar habitats using in-situ materials, addressing radiation, impact, and environmental challenges in space colonization.
