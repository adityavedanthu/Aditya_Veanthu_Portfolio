## **About Me**
Detail-oriented Senior Project Engineer with hands-on experience in digital machining simulation, toolpath optimization, and process validation. Skilled in using CAD/CAM software and Vericut to develop and verify efficient machining strategies that enhance accuracy and reliability. Experienced in collecting and analyzing force, temperature, and sensor data during machining trials, as well as assessing surface quality, tool wear, and part distortion. Known for translating experimental results into concise technical reports and presentations that drive process improvements and innovation. 
Senior Project Engineer specialising in residual stress and distortion prediction within manufacturing processes. Experienced in developing and validating finite element approaches, including contour method back-calculation and element deactivation strategies for distortion modelling.Strong background in digital machining simulation, toolpath optimisation, and virtual machine verification using Vericut. Proficient in integrating CAD/CAM, in-process sensing, and experimental characterisation to link process parameters with structural response, surface integrity, and geometric stability. Skilled in MATLAB and Abaqus (including subroutine development), with a track record of translating experimental and simulation results into structured, production-relevant technical
