The Creaform HandySCAN BLACK Elite, a metrology-grade 3D scanning technology, is highly impactful in the engineering industry. Below is a scan of a 3D-printed cranial implant, which was reverse-engineered into a precise CAD model. This device's accuracy and efficiency are transforming applications that demand high levels of detail and precision. 3D scanning is revolutionizing fields like medical design and manufacturing, enabling faster and more accurate processes than ever before.

## 2. Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF)



Check out this video showcasing the incremental sheet forming (ISF) process. ISF is a flexible, cost-effective, and energy-efficient method that involves deforming sheet metal incrementally using a simple tool directed along a predefined path generated from the CAD model of the product.

## 3. Tap Testing with DigiTap



Tap testing plays a vital role in every machining process, enabling us to assess the integrity of tools, spindles, and machined parts. I had the chance to delve deeper into tap testing through DigiTap, a user-friendly software created by Productive Machines. By analyzing tap test outcomes, one can evaluate machining parameters, anticipate machining stability, and ultimately improve the manufacturing process.

## 4. Metrology Grade 3D Scanning System



I had the valuable opportunity to acquaint myself with the Metrology grade 3D scanning system's hardware, particularly the 'Creaform HandySCAN BLACK Elite.' This system's capability to scan a manufactured part and reverse engineer it into a CAD model proves immensely beneficial in the manufacturing sector, allowing for a comparison between the expected and true design.

## 5. Meeting Astronaut Daniel M. Tani



I had the opportunity to meet Astronaut Daniel M. Tani at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was exciting to hear about his experience living in the International Space Station! Astronaut Tani talked about his teammates, his experience before and during launch, and most importantly highlighted the difference between living in Space and on Earth. I was able to feel his experience and was truly motivated to become one. It was an emotional moment when Mr. Tani was describing his last day in space and that he spent a moment more to experience zero G knowing that would be his last space mission. I am truly grateful for the opportunity :)

## 6. Research Presentation at IAC



Presented my second research titled "Replacement of an Aircraft's Oleo-Pneumatic Hydraulic System with an Electromagnetic Shock Absorbing System", an alternative solution in the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) held in Washington D.C. An inspirational and motivational place for space enthusiasts. It was wonderful interacting with delegates from all around the world, gaining knowledge and opening new paths. Indeed, a memorable experience!! "The power of the past, the promise of the future"
