- Facing and Turning operation on a WFL M30 Millturn using CGTech VERICUT.
The program demonstrates tool setup, work offset (G54), XZ plane selection (G18), constant surface speed (G96) with spindle speed limits, and step-by-step facing and turning passes. This simulation allows for toolpath validation, collision detection, and optimization of machining strategies before running the actual program on the machine.
