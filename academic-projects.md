## Academic Projects

### 1. **Leanspace - Space Hackathon**
Developed a unique satellite monitoring system using the Leanspace Cloud platform to address the issue of space debris. The system features notifications indicating the intensity of critical faults or failures.

### 2. **Deorbit and Solar Cycle**
*Master's Thesis*  
Developed parallel gravity and atmospheric models to predict the lifetime and trajectory of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, considering solar activity, geomagnetic activity, and perturbation effects.  
*Project Guide:* Dr. Patrick Harkness - University of Glasgow

### 3. **Path Planning for Planetary Rovers and Drones**
Developed path planning algorithms and coding sequences for simulations in MATLAB, incorporating fuzzy logic and neural networks to enhance autonomous decision-making capabilities.

### 4. **Fault Detection, Isolation & Recovery System for UAV Heading Motion**
Designed and analyzed a system for fault detection, isolation, and recovery in the lateral dynamics of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), applicable to both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.

### 5. **Flight Control System Design for Restricted Motion Twin Rotor UAV**
*Master's Team Design Project*  
Developed mathematical models to represent elevation, pitch, and yaw motions of a restricted twin UAV system. Implemented control algorithms to command these motions, with results compared against experimental data for fine-tuning.
*Team Members:* Abhijit Tom, Mohit Garg, Kethan Kode, Kavya Venkateshwaran
