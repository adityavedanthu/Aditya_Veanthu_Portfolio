## **Experience**
- **Senior Project Engineer** - Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) - December 2025 - Present - Sheffield, UK  
   I lead and execute projects at the intersection of design, simulation, and testing to drive further innovation in advanced manufacturing.
  
- **Project Engineer** - Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) - June 2023 - Present - Sheffield, UK  
   I work at the intersection of design, simulation, and testing. My experience spans CAD/CAM modelling, virtual machining for process verification and validation, design of experiments, residual stress analysis, developing models for machining distortion prediction and control, 3D scanning of machined parts for geometrical accuracy and conformance, and experimental data collection and analysis.

- **Research Assistant** - University of Glasgow - Jan 2022 - March 2022 - Glasgow, UK  
   I integrated the Pulse Elevator drilling system prototype, a sustainable alternative to traditional augers, with superior adaptability for low or zero gravity environments, demonstrating its potential for aerospace and planetary exploration. This project involved rigorous testing and optimization of granular material management techniques.
